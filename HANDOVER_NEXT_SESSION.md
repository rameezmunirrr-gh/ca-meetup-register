# HANDOVER FOR THE NEXT CLAUDE SESSION

**Project:** Ehsaas'26 meetup registration app (repo `rameezmunirrr-gh/ca-meetup-register`, public; GitHub Pages + Supabase project `CA-meetup-2026`).
**Rewritten:** 26 Oct 2026 (evening, India time), by the session that took the project over from the previous Claude session after its credits ran out. It replaces the earlier version, which had grown into three layers (a 23 Oct body under two "override" blocks) and described a world where nothing was applied yet.
**How it was checked:** against the repo (`main` at `abb7817`, PR #12 merged), the live database snapshot of 26 Oct 11:17 UTC (`b86a59c`, run by the owner by hand on request), and a test database rebuilt from the repo in this session. Where something was NOT verified, the line says so.
**Updated later on 26 Oct 2026 (same day):** the owner's answers to the section-1 questions are recorded in section 1 and 0.1; `PROJECT_NOTES.md` was brought up to date (commit `b53fee7`, verified); the task list in section 11 is updated.
**Updated again on 27 Oct 2026:** Claude now has **push access** to the repo (section 10): it works on a branch and the owner merges the pull request. **All three browser suites were re-run and pass (public 101, admin 47, gate 9).** The public pages were restyled a second time, the whole public text was reworded, the phone layout was fixed, and the payment QR now carries the logo (the owner scanned it in several UPI apps: works). Sections 0.1 to 0.4, 2, 4.1, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11 reflect this.
**Read order:** (1) this file, (2) `PROJECT_NOTES.md` (decision log, database design and changelog; brought up to date on 26 and 27 Oct 2026), (3) the SQL in `sql/` and the tests in `scratch-db/` only when you work on them.
**Where the two documents disagree:** trust the live snapshot and the SQL files + tests first, then this file, then the notes, and tell the owner.

## 0. The 60-second summary

**0.1 What exists and works (all built, tested, applied live)**
- Registration for up to 5 people per booking with a UPI QR for the exact total, a payment screenshot, manual verification by admins (with in-browser OCR to catch reused or fake proofs), numbers given only when a booking is marked paid, QR tickets (JPG/PDF) and a gate scanner.
- **Release 2 is LIVE** (applied by the owner on 25 Oct 2026): ticket lookup by **Booking ID + phone**, email per person (admin-only table), **private and public ticket transfers** through one code flow (admin phone call = identity check), an IP flag (flag only), and the Admin tools for all of it (Transfers tab, money panel, settings).
- Added 25 to 26 Oct and also live: coordinators can transfer (`r2_08`); an About link with an on/off switch (`r2_09`); an Email-box on/off switch (`r2_10`); optional feedback questions on the Booking ID page with a switch and an admin Feedback tab (`r2_11`); a resubmit bug fix; the **restyle** (first version: public pages navy/amber/ivory with the Mallu Articles Bengaluru logo, which was **replaced on 27 Oct 2026**, see the next bullets; Admin and Gate "Midnight Emerald").
- **Owner's answers, 26 Oct 2026 (late):** registration is switched **ON for testing only**; there is **test data only, no real bookings**; **transfers are OFF**; the app is **not ready for launch** (still being modified; the owner will fix all settings when all work is done); the gate members' logins are **not created or tested**; Supabase sign-ups are **OFF** (verified by the owner on 26 Oct). No deadline pressure: the 31 Oct deadline is not to be considered; accuracy and quality come first. See section 1.
- **27 Oct 2026 (all merged by the owner as PRs #13 to #18; nothing in the database changed):** the **public pages were restyled again** to match the owner's own "Join the Event Team" page (dark navy with amber, five accent colours, Manrope; section 4.1); the **whole public text was reworded** (registration, review, payment, done, tickets, closed screens, then the transfer screens, and the About page now says "Coming soon"); the **phone layout was fixed** after the pages were first looked at in a 390 px wide browser (the Review table overflowed and is now stacked cards); the **Done screen** lost its Name/Food table and shows "Share your thoughts" below "Pending verification"; the **payment QR carries the logo** in a round navy patch (section 4.1). Admin and Gate were NOT touched.

**0.2 What is verified, what is not**
- **Verified in this session (26 Oct):** all 10 database suites pass, **675 checks** (62, 54, 153, 157, 77, 68, 36, 14, 26, 28). The live database structure equals the tested one: every function body and execute right, all columns, constraints, indexes, views, row-level security and triggers are identical between the live snapshot and a scratch copy built from the pre-Release-2 snapshot plus `r2_01` to `r2_11`. Remaining differences are Supabase's own items (storage policies, event triggers, `rls_auto_enable`) and Supabase default privilege letters on older objects (see G15).
- **Verified on 27 Oct 2026:** the three browser suites pass: **public 101, admin 47, gate 9** (`scratch-db/browser/`; Chromium and Playwright are pre-installed in the chat sandbox, section 9). The new public screens were also looked at in screenshots at 390 x 844. The payment QR with the logo was decoded by three independent decoders, and then **scanned by the owner in several real UPI apps: it works.**
- **Not verified:** the new public look on a wider range of phones and browsers than the owner's own; the transfer screens against the real database (transfers are off, only simulated data was used); the Google fonts in the sandbox screenshots (a fallback font was shown there).
- **Never verified by anyone:** a complete real payment (real money moving and an admin matching it), and the gate members' logins. The owner has scanned the QR in several UPI apps and checked the 25 Oct rehearsal on their own phone.

**0.3 Documents (state on 26 Oct 2026, later)**
- `PROJECT_NOTES.md`: **brought up to date on 26 Oct 2026 and again on 27 Oct 2026** (first update: commit `b53fee7`; the old Release 2 design and audit sections were removed from it and remain in git history, commit `55c4176`). It describes Release 2, `r2_08` to `r2_11`, the restyle, the switches, the files table and the pre-launch checklist.
- `README.md` contains only the repo name. `sql/README.md` is the owner's guide to the sql folder (not reviewed in this session).

**0.4 Owner:** a beginner working alone, in the browser (GitHub + Supabase). Plain language, step by step. **Since 27 Oct 2026 Claude has push access to the repo: it works on a branch, and the owner opens the pull-request link and presses Create pull request, then Merge** (section 10). Standing order: structure and safety first, looks last (looks and wording of the public pages are now done; Admin and Gate keep their look).

## 1. FIRST QUESTIONS TO ASK THE OWNER (ANSWERED 26 Oct 2026; re-ask only what has changed)

**Owner's answers (26 Oct 2026):**
1. *Situation:* registration is ON for testing; test data only, no real bookings; transfers OFF.
2. *Dates:* the deadline is 31 Oct 2026, but Claude is **not to mind it**: focus only on accurate, high-quality working results, wasting no time, credits or effort. The real opening date is not fixed.
3. *Pre-launch checklist:* **not ready for launch**; still under modification; the owner will fix all settings when all work is done. Gate members' logins **not tested** (not created). **Supabase sign-ups: OFF, verified by the owner on 26 Oct 2026.** Real UPI ID / payee / WhatsApp, the real test payment and the final price: not asked yet (still to do at launch time).
4. *Delivery:* the previous Claude session was disconnected from the repo and is not linked to anything. Claude is now the owner's **instructor** and delivers **complete files** for upload in the GitHub web editor, then verifies against a fresh download. (Verified working on 26 Oct: `git clone` and `curl` on raw URLs.) **Changed on 27 Oct 2026:** the owner attached the repo to the chat with push access, so Claude now pushes branches and the owner merges the pull request (section 10).
5. *SQL after `r2_11`:* not asked; the snapshot of 26 Oct 11:17 UTC shows nothing newer than `r2_11`. Ask again if the owner reports running anything.

The original questions follow, for reference.

1. **What is today's real situation?** Is registration still closed? Are there real bookings, or test data again since the clean-up on 25 Oct (`r2_07`)? Are transfers still OFF?
2. **Dates.** The last record says: deadline 31 Oct 2026 23:59:59 IST (check Admin → Settings), event Sunday 22 Nov 2026 2 PM at Savoury Business Hotel, Madiwala. What is the real opening date, and should the deadline move?
3. **Pre-launch checklist** (notes section 11, status unknown): real UPI ID, payee name and WhatsApp number entered; a small real test payment scanned in two UPI apps; the gate members' logins created and tested; price final (₹250 and cap 150 were the last recorded values); sign-ups still off in Supabase Auth.
4. **How changes are delivered now.** The previous session pushed branches and pull requests through a GitHub connection; the owner merged each PR. That connection has been removed (owner, 26 Oct 2026). Unless the owner chooses another route, deliver **complete files** for the owner to upload in the GitHub web editor, then verify against a fresh download of the repo.
5. If any SQL was run in Supabase after `r2_11`: ask for it, add it to `sql/changes.sql`, and run the Database Snapshot workflow.

## 2. STATE OF EACH ENVIRONMENT

| Place | What is there (verified 26 Oct 2026 unless stated) |
|---|---|
| **Live Supabase** | Release 2 fully applied: `r2_01` to `r2_06` (kept as `sql/rollout_A_part1_APPLIED.sql` = r2_01 + r2_02 and `sql/rollout_A_part2_APPLIED.sql` = r2_02b + r2_03 + r2_04 + r2_05 + r2_06), the data clean-up `r2_07`, then `r2_08`, `r2_09`, `r2_10`, `r2_11`. Evidence: the snapshot `b86a59c` contains `ask_email`, `ask_feedback`, `booking_feedback`, `submit_feedback`, the three switch functions, and its function bodies equal the scratch copy. 14 tables/views, 64 functions (19 internal helpers). Settings and data are not in the snapshot. |
| **Repo `main`** | At `3214cea` (27 Oct 2026, PR #18 merged). `index.html` (about 87 KB), `admin/index.html` (about 67 KB), `gate/index.html` (about 20 KB), `assets/` (logo files), `sql/`, `scratch-db/`, `.github/workflows/`, this file, `PROJECT_NOTES.md`, `README.md`. 18 pull requests merged in all. All feature branches are merged and still exist on GitHub (`about-link`, `admin-newid`, `amount-warning`, `coordinator-transfer`, `email-order`, `email-switch`, `feedback`, `feedback-others-count`, `fix-resubmit`, `notes-live`, `release-2`, `restyle`, `restyle-team-theme`, `wording-mobile`, `done-remove-table`, `payment-qr-logo`, `payment-qr-circle`, `transfer-wording`): the owner can delete them (housekeeping, optional). |
| **GitHub Pages** | The "pages build and deployment" runs #153 to #159 on 26 Oct were all green in the owner's screenshot (the latest about 16:30 IST, right after PR #12). |
| **GitHub Actions** | `Database Snapshot` (nightly 2:00 AM India time, also by hand: Actions → Database Snapshot → Run workflow; writes `sql/schema_snapshot.txt` only when something changed), `Supabase Keepalive` (every 3 days, keeps the free project awake), and GitHub's own pages build. |
| **Test database** | Not part of the live system. Rebuilt from the repo in each chat (section 9). |

**The `sql/` folder**

| File | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema_snapshot.txt` | Nightly export of the live structure. The truth. Never edit by hand. |
| `changes.sql` | Hand-kept history of SQL run in Supabase (newest entries are at the TOP for r2_10 and r2_11, and a Release-2 note is at the bottom). Not guaranteed complete. |
| `r2_01` to `r2_06` (+ `r2_02b`, `r2_02c`) | Release 2 backend pieces. Applied. Kept because the tests build on them. |
| `r2_07_cleanup_test_data.sql` | Deletes ALL bookings, tickets, emails, transfers, IP records, scans and sessions, restarts numbering at 1, switches transfers off; keeps staff, settings and the settings log. **Refuses to run while registration is open.** Run once on 25 Oct. Do not run again after real bookings exist. |
| `r2_08` coordinators can transfer; `r2_09` About switch; `r2_10` Email switch; `r2_11` feedback | Applied. |
| `archive/r2_04_admin_matched_NOT_USED.sql` (and `scratch-db/archive/`) | Abandoned designs. **Never apply.** |

## 3. THE TRANSFER CASE, EXPLAINED IN FULL (reused from the earlier handover, patched for r2_08 to r2_11)

### 3.1 The idea in plain words

The meetup is limited to a hall of 150. People cannot get refunds, only **transfers**: a ticket holder who cannot come hands the seat to someone else. The organisers handle this by **phone**; the app records it and makes it safe. There are two kinds, but one single flow of screens:

- **Private transfer:** the two people already know each other. Money is settled **between them**; the organisers are never involved in money.
- **Public transfer:** the seller has no buyer. The organisers find one, collect the money, and pay the seller. They are intermediaries.

**The same code flow serves both.** The seller fills a form and gets a short **code**. Someone gives that code to a buyer (the seller themself in a private case; an admin in a public case). The buyer types the code, fills a Transfer Form, and gets a **new Booking ID**. An admin phones the **seller's registered number** (this call is the real identity check), ticks a box, and presses **Transfer**. In one database step the seller's ticket is cancelled and a new ticket is issued to the buyer. The number of people in the hall never changes.

### 3.2 The objects involved

| Thing | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `transfers` | One sale of one seat. Columns: `kind` (`private`/`public`), `status`, `code`, `code_expires_at`, seller snapshot (`seller_name`, `seller_phone`), call tick (`seller_call_confirmed_at/by`), and for **public**: `seller_upi`, `amount_due`, `payment_requested_*`, `payment_screenshot_path`, `payment_submitted_at`, `payment_verified_*`, `amount_received`, `seller_paid_*`, `payout_reference`, `return_due`, `returned_*`, `return_reference`. Admin-read-only. |
| `transfer_buyers` | The buyer's form (name, phone, email (may be empty when the Email switch is OFF), location, attendance, food, consent, `booking_id`). Admin-read-only. |
| `bookings.kind` | `registration` (normal) or `transfer` (a buyer's booking: **amount 0, no screenshot, no ticket until approved**, never counts as a seat or as income). |
| `tickets.transferred_out_at` | Set on the seller's ticket when it is transferred away. The row **stays**, with its number retired forever. **Every count of people must ignore rows where this is set.** |
| `tickets.transferred_from` | On the buyer's new ticket: points to the seller's old ticket. Used by the gate to follow a seat that moved more than once. |
| `ticket_emails` | Admin-only table (`ticket_id`, `email`). `tickets` has NO email column (emails were moved out on 24 Oct so gate staff cannot read them). Filled by `submit_booking` and the Transfer step. When the Email switch is OFF nothing is asked or stored; emails already collected stay. |
| `booking_ips` | Admin-only IP per registration (flag only). |
| `settings_log` | Every transfer step is written here (`area = 'transfer'`), with who did it, never with phones, emails, UPI IDs or QR secrets. |

**`transfers.status` values in use:** `code_active` (seller made a code, no buyer yet), `pending_admin` (buyer applied, waiting for the admin), `done`, `rejected`, `withdrawn` (closed automatically, e.g. the seller's booking was rejected), `replaced` (a newer code for the same seat). Only one of `code_active`/`pending_admin` can exist per seat (database-enforced).

**`transfer_buyers.status`:** `active` (applied) → `done` / `rejected` / `released`.

### 3.3 Who can do what (permissions)

- **Visitors (no login):** only the functions in section 7.1. They can never read any table.
- **Gate staff:** can read `tickets`/`bookings` (existing rule) and use `admit_ticket`. They see **zero rows** of the new transfer tables and of `booking_ips`.
- **Admins:** read all transfer tables and call the `admin_*` functions. **One admin will do the transfer work in practice; every admin has the authority.** Every admin function checks `is_admin()` itself.

### 3.4 Scenarios (each lists what happens, what changes, what the screens must show)

**S1. Private transfer, normal case** (money between seller and buyer)
1. *Seller* (Asha, ticket E26-001, Booking ID `A`, phone P1) opens Tickets, Transfer tickets, Private, **Sell**, enters Booking ID + ticket number + phone. `private_sell` creates a `transfers` row (`private`, `code_active`, code valid `private_code_hours`: 2 h by default in the database; the owner set 24 h in Admin → Settings → Transfers). Screen: the 6-character code and when it expires (alphabet `ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789`: no 0, O, 1, I).
2. Asha tells the buyer the code by herself (WhatsApp, etc.).
3. *Buyer* opens Private, **Buy**, types the code: `transfer_open` returns `{ok, mode:'private', seller_name, expires_at, food_locked, food}`. The buyer fills the Transfer Form (name, phone, email, location, attendance, food, consent tick that money is between the two people) and sends `transfer_submit`. Result: a **new Booking ID** (kind `transfer`, pending), the transfer becomes `pending_admin`. Screen: "The organizers will be notified…", the Booking ID (saved on the device), a Contact now button. **No ticket, no seat, no change to any count yet.**
4. *Admin* sees the pending transfer: the original ticket beside the buyer's details. Phones the **seller's registered number** (not the number typed in any form): "Shall I transfer this ticket to Mr. B? We assume the payment is settled between you." Ticks the box (`admin_transfer_confirm_call`).
5. *Admin* presses **Transfer** (`admin_transfer_approve`). One transaction: re-checks the seller's ticket is still valid and **not checked in**; creates the buyer's ticket with the **next guest number** and a new QR secret in the buyer's booking; sets the seller's ticket `transferred_out_at`; marks the buyer's booking paid and numbers it with the normal rule; transfer becomes `done`; writes the log.
6. Result: seller's lookup shows the ticket as transferred (no QR); buyer's lookup shows the new ticket; the gate shows the old QR as CANCELLED (naming the current holder); all counts unchanged.

**S2. Public transfer, normal case** (money through the organisers)
1. *Seller* chooses Public, **Sell**: Booking ID, ticket, phone **and payout UPI ID** (or 10-digit phone). **No price.** `public_sell` makes a `public` code (same lifetime rules).
2. *Admin* sees every active code in the Transfers tab (both kinds). The seller usually contacts the admin; the admin finds a buyer and gives them the code. If finding a buyer takes days the admin **extends** the code (`admin_transfer_extend_code`, 1 to 168 hours; also revives an expired code).
3. *Buyer* types the code and fills the Transfer Form (no payment yet). Gets a new Booking ID; the buyer's status page shows "pending".
4. *Admin* phones the seller (is the ticket still theirs? reads back the payout UPI ID), ticks the call, presses **Ask buyer to pay** (`admin_transfer_request_payment`). `amount_due` is fixed to the standard `price_per_head` at that moment.
5. *Buyer's* status page (Booking ID + phone) now shows **Pay ₹X** with the UPI QR (from `get_payment_info`) and a screenshot upload. The page uploads the image to the `payment-proofs` bucket as `<submission_id>.jpg` and calls `transfer_pay`.
6. *Admin* checks the bank and enters the amount **actually received** (any amount from 1 to 1,000,000; more or less than asked is fine): `admin_transfer_verify_payment`.
7. *Admin* presses **Transfer**: needs **both** the call tick **and** the verified payment. Same swap as S1.
8. *Admin* pays the seller **exactly the amount received** and marks it with a reference (`admin_transfer_mark_paid`).
9. The **Transfer money panel** (`admin_transfer_money`) shows: awaiting payment, awaiting verification, verified and waiting for Transfer, to pay out, paid out, return due, returned, **held now**. The buyer's money never enters the registration revenue (their booking has amount 0).

**S3. Public transfer fails after the buyer paid** (the money must go back)
- *Cases:* the seller walked into the hall (Transfer refused: `SELLER_CHECKED_IN`), the seller's booking was rejected by an admin (the transfer closes **automatically**), the admin rejects it (wrong person, seller unreachable), the amount is wrong.
- *What happens:* `admin_transfer_reject` (or the automatic close) sets `return_due = true` **if a screenshot was uploaded**. The panel shows it under "return due". The admin sends the money back and records it with `admin_transfer_mark_returned(transfer, reference)` (a reference like "no money received" is acceptable). The buyer's page shows `return_due` then `returned`. The seller's seat is untouched and they can start a new transfer.
- *If the buyer never uploaded a screenshot:* no return is created.

**S4. The hall is full** (the normal reason transfers exist)
- Registrations are refused (`NOT_ENOUGH_SPOTS`), but a transfer is a **swap**, not a new seat, so it must always work. Tested: with the cap reached, Transfer works and the hall stays exactly as full; a normal registration is still refused afterwards.

**S5. A seat moves twice or more.** The buyer has a Booking ID, ticket number and phone, so they can sell on like any ticket (owner's decision). The old tickets keep their retired numbers; the gate follows `transferred_from` links to name the **current** holder.

**S6. Code problems.** A second request for the same seat **replaces** the old code (the old one stops working, even across private/public). The seller can cancel an active code (`transfer_cancel`); once a buyer applied only an admin can end it (`CONTACT_ADMIN`). Wrong, expired, used, replaced or cancelled codes all answer exactly `INVALID_CODE`. Two buyers racing for one code: the first valid submission wins (tested with 8 at once). The same form sent twice returns the same Booking ID.

**S7. Rules that block a transfer** (shown to the seller only after the three details matched): `NOT_CONFIRMED` (booking not paid), `ALREADY_CHECKED_IN`, `ALREADY_TRANSFERRED`, `TRANSFERS_CLOSED`, `CUTOFF_PASSED` (after `transfer_cutoff_at` no new code, buyer form or payment upload; admin actions on existing transfers continue). A seller with wrong details always gets exactly `MISMATCH` and learns nothing. **Coordinator tickets CAN be sold** (owner decision 25 Oct 2026, built in `r2_08`): the buyer always becomes a normal GUEST (only an admin can make a coordinator), the coordinator's guest number and coordinator number are both retired for good, and an admin can no longer change the coordinator status of a ticket that was already transferred away (`ALREADY_TRANSFERRED`). There are no free passes: guests of honour enter without registration or gate checks and are outside this app.

**S8. Food lock.** Once the food order is placed the admin turns on `transfer_food_locked`: the form hides the food choice and the buyer gets the **seller's** food.

**S9. Gate day.** `admit_ticket` on a transferred-out ticket returns `cancelled` with the **current holder's name and ticket label** and the old label. The new ticket admits once, then `already_scanned`. Gate staff searching by name can still find retired tickets (see section 4, Gate).

**S10. Abuse and mistakes.** Seller and buyer never see each other's phone, email, Booking ID or ticket number (the seller sees the buyer's **name** after they applied; the buyer sees the seller's **name** when the form opens). Guessing: Booking ID (8 hex) + phone, or a 6-character code (about a billion combinations), is not throttled by owner's decision because the admin's phone call to the seller stops a wrong taker. IP flag: registrations record the visitor's address; admin sees addresses with 5 or more registrations; **never blocks**.

**S11. Cleaning test data before launch.** Transfer rows are removed with their tickets/bookings by foreign keys; `settings_log` is not cleared (fine); also empty the `payment-proofs` bucket. `admin_clear_client_ips()` deletes all stored IPs after the event.

## 4. THE PAGES AS BUILT (26 Oct 2026)

All three are single HTML files with inline JavaScript and the Supabase client `db`, drawing views by building HTML strings. Only the public publishable key is in them (safe by design). Everything that changes data goes through database functions.

### 4.1 Public page `index.html`
- **Look (second restyle, 27 Oct 2026, modelled on the owner's "Join the Event Team" page):** page `#081020`; a navy hero gradient (`#000838` to `#081860`) with two soft discs behind the heading; dark cards `#101838` with a 3 px amber (`#F0A000`) top edge; amber primary buttons with dark text; five accent colours (pink `#D82890`, violet `#7820E0`, teal `#20C8A0`, blue `#3050F0`, orange `#E86818`) used for the option chips (outlined, filled when chosen), the small bar before a card heading and a thin stripe under the header; font **Manrope** for everything on screen. **Fraunces and Jost are still loaded on purpose: the ticket IMAGE (drawn on a canvas) still uses them and is unchanged.** Home keeps a navy invitation card with the logo. Motion: cards below the fold fade and rise in on scroll (`reveal()`; switched off for reduced motion), heading bars grow from a dot, chips pop when chosen, buttons lift on hover. Dark only (no light mode). CSS variables: `--bg`, `--card`, `--ink`, `--mute`, `--brand` (blue), `--accent` (amber), `--pink`, `--violet`, `--teal`, `--orange`. Logo files in `assets/`: `logo-mark.png` (transparent), `icon-192.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `og-image.jpg` (the WhatsApp preview). The owner has not supplied an SVG.
- **Phone first:** the layout was checked at 390 x 844. Review shows each person as a stacked card (no table, so nothing overflows); below 480 px buttons use less padding so labels like "Download QR" stay on one line; option chips are about 44 px tall; the consent checkbox is 22 px and amber; `main` keeps the safe-area padding.
- **Wording (27 Oct 2026):** all visitor text was rewritten to be clearer and more professional (registration, review, payment, done, tickets, closed and error screens, the transfer screens and the shared error messages in `XERR`). Meaning and rules did not change. Note for later edits: **`scratch-db/browser/run_public.py` has many checks that look for exact sentences; update them with any wording change.**
- **Flags:** on load the page calls `get_site_flags()`; `S.flags.show_about`, `ask_email` and `ask_feedback` switch the About link, the Email boxes and the feedback questions. If the call fails the page behaves as the defaults (all on).
- **Views (`S.step`):** `loading`, `home`, `about` (says "Coming soon" until the owner sends content), `closed`, `error`; registration: `form` (1 to 5 people, fixed "+91" box, Email right after Phone when the switch is on), `summary`, `pay` (UPI QR drawn in the page with the logo in a round patch, copy UPI ID, share/download QR, screenshot upload), `done` (Booking ID, "Pending verification", then the optional "Share your thoughts" feedback card; no Name/Food table); `tickets` (Booking ID + phone, saved Booking IDs as tap-to-fill chips, never the phone), `ticket` (tickets drawn on a canvas, JPG/PDF; a navy header with the logo; guest badge amber, coordinator badge ivory with maroon accents; no Booking ID drawn on the ticket); transfers: `xmenu` (Transfer tickets, shown only when `get_transfer_info().open` and the cut-off has not passed), `xsell` (seller form, private or public), `xcode` (the seller's code, its expiry and a Copy button; the seller's later status and a Cancel-code button appear on the Tickets page for a confirmed booking, via `transfer_status` and `transfer_cancel`), `xbuy` (type the code; ONE "I want to buy" button, the code itself decides private or public), `xform` (Transfer Form), `xdone` (the buyer's new Booking ID), `tpay` (public buyer: amount, UPI QR, screenshot upload).
- **On the device:** only Booking IDs are remembered (`mm_mine` up to 20, `mm_hist` up to 10, `mm_last`). The phone number is never stored.
- **Payment QR with the logo (27 Oct 2026):** `drawQR()` draws the QR with error-correction level **Q** and a navy circle 24% of the QR's width carrying the logo (`paintLogo`, logo preloaded as `QRLOGO`). Used by the Pay and transfer-Pay screens, so also by Share QR and Download QR. The TICKET QR (`drawTickets`) is unchanged. Tested with the real `qrcode-generator` and three decoders (OpenCV, ZXing, jsQR) on five UPI links at several sizes, blurred and as JPEG: readable up to about 28% (square patch), failing from 35%; an oversized circle fails every copy. **Level H was tried and is WORSE**: the QR gets so dense (up to 65 x 65 modules) that decoders miss it even without a logo. Do not enlarge the logo or change the level without re-running that test (method in section 9). The owner scanned the QR in several UPI apps on 27 Oct 2026: it works.
- **Resubmit rule:** `S.sid` (the submission ID) is the idempotency key of `submit_booking`. After a SUCCESSFUL booking `resetBookingForm()` clears the form and the ID; a FAILED send keeps the same ID on purpose (no duplicate bookings). This was a real bug fixed on 26 Oct.
- **Daily pause + 10-minute grace** and the heartbeat every 30 seconds are unchanged from Release 1 (notes section 8).

### 4.2 Admin `admin/index.html` (admins only; gate staff see "This page is for admins")
- **Look:** "Midnight Emerald", different from the public pages by the owner's request: light `#EAF2EE`/`#0B5D45`, dark `#06120E`/`#3FD0A0`, gold accent, header `#062A1F`; font Bricolage Grotesque; follows the device's light/dark setting; shows the logo in the header.
- **Tabs:** Overview, Bookings, People, **Transfers** (appears only once the database has the transfer tables; shows the number waiting), Scan screenshots, **Feedback** (appears only when the feedback table exists; lists answers with the average and a 1-to-5 split; multi-person bookings show "Name and N others"), Settings. The page still loads on a database that lacks a newer piece (it hides the tab or card instead of crashing).
- **Counts** are computed in the browser from the tickets and bookings it reads and **ignore retired tickets** (`transferred_out_at`); transfer bookings are hidden from Bookings and from the OCR queue (they live in Transfers; the buyer's new Booking ID is shown in the Transfers history and in People).
- **People:** Email column (and in the CSV), retired tickets greyed as Transferred.
- **Transfers tab:** money panel, waiting transfers (call tick → ask to pay → verify amount → Transfer, or Reject), active codes with Extend and Cancel, seller payouts, buyer returns, history. Verifying an amount that differs from the amount asked shows a warning; whole rupees only.
- **Settings cards:** Registration settings, Payment details (locked until Change is pressed), Event details, Ticket transfers, Repeat-registration flag (IP threshold), About link, Email box, Feedback questions, Settings log, and a "Before you open registration" checklist. An IP banner appears on Overview, with a per-booking mark and a button to delete stored addresses.
- It reads these tables directly (allowed to staff by row-level security): `bookings`, `tickets`, `screenshot_scans`, `settings`, `settings_log`, `staff`, and (admins only) `ticket_emails`, `transfers`, `transfer_buyers`, `booking_feedback`.

### 4.3 Gate `gate/index.html` (any staff)
- Same Midnight Emerald theme and logo as Admin. Live counters (Present / Confirmed, Veg, Non-veg) refreshed every 30 seconds, camera scan (jsQR) of `E26-007|<12 hex>` or `E26-001C|<12 hex>`, "Find a person" search, result overlays: ADMITTED, ALREADY SCANNED, PAYMENT PENDING (Approve and admit marks the whole booking paid), PAYMENT REJECTED, TICKET CANCELLED (names the current holder and ticket), INVALID TICKET, COULDN'T CHECK.
- Counters and search **ignore retired tickets**: it reads `transferred_out_at` (and retries without the column on an older database). Search still finds a retired ticket, shows a Transferred pill and the note "Ask for their current ticket", and never offers Admit.
- The only function it calls is `admit_ticket`.

## 5. SETTINGS AND SWITCHES

| What | Column in `settings` | Changed by (admin only, logged) | Visitors read it through |
|---|---|---|---|
| Registration open, cap, price per person, deadline, daily pause | `is_open`, `cap`, `price_per_head`, `deadline`, `pause_*`, `closed_at`, `grace_minutes` (fixed 10) | `admin_update_settings` | `get_public_status` |
| Event date and venue | `event_at`, `venue` | `admin_set_event` | `get_event_info` |
| UPI ID, payee name, WhatsApp number | `upi_id`, `payee_name`, `whatsapp_number` | `admin_set_payment_info` (format-checked; a banner shows the other admin for 7 days) | `get_payment_info` |
| Transfers on/off, cut-off time, food lock, code lifetime (1 to 168 h), IP flag threshold (2 to 1000) | `transfers_open`, `transfer_cutoff_at`, `transfer_food_locked`, `private_code_hours`, `ip_flag_threshold` | `admin_set_transfer_settings` (refuses to switch transfers ON while the UPI ID, payee name or WhatsApp number is missing: `PAYMENT_INFO_MISSING`) | `get_transfer_info` (not the threshold) |
| About link | `show_about` (default ON) | `admin_set_show_about` | `get_site_flags` |
| Email box | `ask_email` (default ON) | `admin_set_ask_email` | `get_site_flags` |
| Feedback questions | `ask_feedback` (default ON) | `admin_set_ask_feedback` | `get_site_flags` |
| (unused) | `max_resale_price` | nobody | nobody |

Switch behaviour: **Email OFF**: forms hide the box, no email is asked or stored, emails already collected stay (admin-only). **Feedback OFF**: the questions are hidden and `submit_feedback` answers `FEEDBACK_OFF`; saved answers stay. Feedback is one row per registration booking (rating 1 to 5 and/or a comment up to 1000 characters; sending again replaces it), readable by admins only. `ticket_emails`, `transfers`, `transfer_buyers`, `booking_ips` and `booking_feedback` are admin-read-only; gate staff see zero rows. Values at the last record (14 to 16 Oct, notes section 1): cap 150, price ₹250, deadline 31 Oct 2026 23:59:59 IST; the owner set the transfer code lifetime to 24 hours. **Read the live values in Admin → Settings; the database is the truth.**

## 6. DECISIONS AND HISTORY

### 6.1 Owner decisions made 25 to 26 Oct 2026 (they replace the defaults of the old section 8)
1. Money is returned to a public buyer who paid when the transfer fails (recorded as a return with a reference; normal registrations stay no-refund).
2. Transfer codes last 24 hours (setting; the admin can also Extend any code up to 168 h).
3. No extra spam protection for now (the IP flag only; it never blocks).
4. Waiting transfers do not expire by themselves (the admin sees the age).
5. **Coordinators can transfer their ticket** like anyone else (`r2_08`).
6. **There are no free passes**: guests of honour enter without registration or gate checks, outside this app.
7. Seller and buyer see only each other's NAME (never phone, email, UPI, ticket number or Booking ID).
8. The text says the organisers "may call" (not "will call").
9. The two "I want to buy" buttons were merged into one (the code decides private or public; a private code typed in the public flow works by design).
Earlier, still binding: emails admin-only in their own table (G3); Booking ID + phone for ticket lookup; a received ticket can be sold on; no marketplace; tap-to-pay `upi://` links must never return; no Booking ID on the ticket image; numbers are never reused (notes section 9).

### 6.1b Owner decisions of 27 Oct 2026
1. The **public pages** take the look of the owner's "Join the Event Team" page and are **phone first**. **Admin and Gate are not changed** (they keep Midnight Emerald).
2. Public text should be clear, short and professional. The owner's example: the feedback box says "Please share a few words about the program" with a placeholder ("It could be anything: your suggestions, expectations, ideas and more. This helps us run the program better!"). Two sentences that the old tests called "exact" were reworded in the same pass: the Request-received line (now "The organisers have been notified of your request and will take the next steps shortly.") and the mismatch message (now "The details don't match. Please check the Booking ID, the ticket number and the phone number registered for that ticket."). The owner may ask to revert them.
3. The **logo goes on the PAYMENT QR only**, in a circle in the centre; never on the ticket QR.
4. The **Done screen**: no Name/Food table; "Share your thoughts" sits below "Pending verification".
5. The About page stays a placeholder ("Coming soon") until the owner sends the content.

### 6.2 What happened
- **16 to 17 Oct:** Release 1 done; Release 2 designed and its database part written and tested on a scratch Postgres (pieces 1 to 5).
- **23 to 24 Oct:** first handover written; emails moved to `ticket_emails`; piece 6; all three pages rewritten; 572 database checks + 108 browser checks.
- **25 Oct:** rollout with the owner: snapshot, `r2_01` + `r2_02`, pages published (PR #1, then PR #2 for the "New Booking ID" line), `r2_02b` to `r2_06`, snapshot comparison (identical), rehearsal on the real site (registration with email and +91; lookup by Booking ID + phone; private transfer; public transfer with screenshot, verify, transfer, payout; reject path; gate refused the old QR and showed retired tickets as Transferred). The real visitor IP showed in both `cf=` and `xff=` of `booking_ips.raw`, so the IP-header question (G10) is closed. Test data was cleaned with `r2_07` and the `payment-proofs` bucket emptied.
- **25 to 26 Oct:** `r2_08` (coordinators), amount-difference warning, About link (`r2_09`), restyle with the logo (public) and Midnight Emerald (admin, gate), Email switch (`r2_10`) and the email-after-phone order, feedback (`r2_11`), the resubmit fix, the "and N others" wording. Each was a branch + pull request merged by the owner; rule used: **run the SQL FIRST, then merge the PR** (the pages cope with the database being one step behind).
- **26 to 27 Oct (the next session):** push access to the repo was attached; the three browser suites were re-run (101 / 47 / 9); the public pages were restyled (PR #13), reworded and fixed for phones (#14), the Done screen was changed (#15), the payment QR got the logo (#16, then a round patch in #17), and the transfer screens and About page were reworded (#18). Each was a branch + pull request merged by the owner. No SQL was run.

## 7. API REFERENCE (from the live snapshot of 26 Oct 2026; real responses in Appendix B)

### 7.1 Visitor functions (anyone with the public key)

Seller, buyer and feedback functions never raise for user mistakes; they **return** `{ok:false, error:'CODE'}` (one shape for the page). Lookups return `{found:false}` for every kind of wrong input.

| Function | Parameters | Success |
|---|---|---|
| `get_public_status(p_session)` | session uuid or null | registration state, spots left, price, max group, pause info |
| `registration_heartbeat(p_session)` | | same JSON (daily-pause logic) |
| `get_payment_info()` | | UPI ID, payee name, WhatsApp number (null = not set up) |
| `get_event_info()` | | `event_at`, `venue` |
| `get_site_flags()` | | `{show_about, ask_email, ask_feedback}` |
| `get_transfer_info()` | | `{open, cutoff_at, cutoff_passed, food_locked, code_hours, ask_price, server_now}` |
| `submit_booking(p_submission_id, p_people jsonb, p_screenshot_path)` | 1 to 5 objects `name, phone (10 digits), email (not needed when the Email switch is off), loc, att, food` | the booking (code, status, tickets); **raises** on invalid input |
| `submit_feedback(p_booking_code, p_rating, p_comment)` | rating 1 to 5 and/or comment | `{ok:true}` or `{ok:false,error}` |
| `lookup_tickets(p_code, p_phone)` | Booking ID + 10-digit phone | `{found:true, kind, booking_code, status, people_count, amount_expected, tickets:[...]}`; transfer bookings also `transfer:{type, state, amount_due}` |
| `private_sell(p_booking_code, p_ticket, p_phone)` | ticket like `E26-001` | `{ok, code, expires_at, hours, ticket_label}` |
| `public_sell(p_booking_code, p_ticket, p_phone, p_upi)` | + payout UPI/phone | `{ok, mode:'public', code, expires_at, hours, ticket_label}` |
| `transfer_status(p_booking_code, p_phone)` | the seller | `{found, transfers:[...]}` |
| `transfer_cancel(p_booking_code, p_ticket, p_phone)` | the seller | `{ok}`; `CONTACT_ADMIN` once a buyer applied |
| `transfer_open(p_code)` | the buyer | `{ok, mode, seller_name, expires_at, food_locked, food?}` |
| `transfer_submit(p_code, p_submission_id, p_buyer jsonb)` | `name, phone, email (optional when the switch is off), loc, att, food (ignored when locked), consent:'true'` | `{ok, mode, booking_code, status:'pending', seller_name, food}` |
| `transfer_pay(p_booking_code, p_phone, p_submission_id, p_screenshot_path)` | public buyer, after payment was requested | `{ok, amount_due}` |

Screenshots go straight to the `payment-proofs` storage bucket (anyone may upload, only staff may read through short-lived signed links; size limit and image types enforced), named `<submission_id>.<jpg|png|webp>`.

### 7.2 Staff and admin functions (login required; each checks the role inside)
- **Staff:** `admit_ticket`, `save_scan`, `admin_registration_status`, `is_staff`.
- **Admin, existing:** `undo_checkin`, `set_booking_status` (refuses transfer bookings: `USE_TRANSFER_TOOLS`), `set_coordinator` (refuses a retired ticket: `ALREADY_TRANSFERRED`), `admin_update_settings`, `admin_set_event`, `admin_set_payment_info`, `admin_payment_alert`, `is_admin`.
- **Admin, Release 2:** `admin_set_transfer_settings`, `admin_set_show_about`, `admin_set_ask_email`, `admin_set_ask_feedback`, `admin_transfer_confirm_call(id, bool)`, `admin_transfer_extend_code(id, hours)`, `admin_transfer_request_payment(id)`, `admin_transfer_verify_payment(id, amount)`, `admin_transfer_approve(id)`, `admin_transfer_reject(id, note)`, `admin_transfer_mark_paid(id, reference)`, `admin_transfer_mark_returned(id, reference)`, `admin_transfer_money()`, `admin_ip_flags()`, `admin_clear_client_ips()`.
- **Internal (not callable by anyone but the database owner):** 19 helpers such as `_assign_numbers`, `_booking_json`, `_client_ip`, `_find_seller_ticket`, `_tlog`. `_ticket_label` is callable by anyone (pure formatting, harmless). `rls_auto_enable` is Supabase's own event-trigger function.

### 7.3 Rules the database enforces that the page need not repeat (but should mirror)

One open transfer per seat; a code is unique among active codes; Transfer needs the call tick (and, for public, a verified payment); the seller's ticket must be paid, a guest ticket, not checked in and not already transferred; a transfer booking never counts as a seat or as income; the swap uses the normal numbering rule (`_assign_numbers`) and never reuses a number; the cap is never checked at Transfer (it is a swap).


---

## 8. OPEN ITEMS AND RISKS

### 8.1 Open decisions and unknowns (ask the owner)
1. **Registration opening date and the deadline** (section 1, question 2). Owner, 26 Oct: not fixed; not to be considered for now.
2. **The pre-launch checklist** (section 1, question 3), including a real payment in a real UPI app (never verified). Owner, 26 Oct: not ready; sign-ups confirmed off; gate logins not created.
3. **Daily pause and transfers:** should transfers pause too? Default in use: no.
4. **About page content** (text, reels as links, photos with permission for faces) and the logo as an **SVG** (only a PNG exists). The About page currently says "Coming soon" (reworded 27 Oct 2026).
5. **After the event:** run `select admin_ip_flags();` once to review, then `select admin_clear_client_ips();` to delete every stored address. Decide what to do with emails, feedback comments and payment screenshots (nothing sends email yet; no retention rule exists).
6. **Staff:** the owner and one friend are admins; the two gate members and any other organisers are added at the end (notes section 2: Supabase Authentication user, then a `staff` row with the role written explicitly).

### 8.2 Status of the gaps found in the 17 Oct review
| ID | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | No function to change the transfer settings | Resolved: `admin_set_transfer_settings` (r2_06) |
| G2 | No visitor-readable "are transfers open" | Resolved: `get_transfer_info` (r2_06) |
| G3 | Emails readable by every staff login | Resolved: separate admin-only table `ticket_emails` |
| G4, G5, G6 | Admin and gate double counting; admin lists transfer bookings; Tickets page auto-fetch | Resolved in the rewritten pages (browser suites re-run and passing on 27 Oct 2026) |
| G7 | Wrong rollout order breaks things | Done in the right order on 25 Oct. For any future piece: SQL first, then merge the page |
| G8 | Scratch copy did not reproduce old-table permissions | Resolved (`build.py` reproduces RLS and grants from the snapshot) |
| G9 | `_ticket_label` callable by anyone | Open, harmless |
| G10 | Which header carries the real IP | Closed 25 Oct (both `cf=` and `xff=` showed the real address; the code prefers `cf-connecting-ip`) |
| G11 | `baseline.py` obsolete | Done (deleted) |
| G12 | Pending transfers never expire | Owner decision: stays manual; the admin sees the age |
| G13 | Coordinator tickets cannot be sold | Resolved: they can (r2_08) |
| G14 | No rollback picture | The nightly snapshot history, `changes.sql` and the `rollout_A_*_APPLIED.sql` files |

### 8.3 New findings of this session (26 Oct 2026)
- **G15 (low, optional):** Supabase's default privileges (TRUNCATE, REFERENCES, TRIGGER, MAINTAIN) exist on a few older objects for the API roles: `keepalive` (anon and authenticated), `report` (anon), and for `service_role` on most tables. They are not reachable through the API (it cannot issue TRUNCATE) and the new tables carry only staff SELECT. If the owner wants it tidy: revoke truncate, references and trigger on `keepalive` and `report` from `anon, authenticated` in the SQL editor, then re-run the snapshot. **Not applied, not tested.**
- **G16:** the documents were stale (section 0.3). **Resolved 26 Oct 2026:** this file was rewritten and `PROJECT_NOTES.md` brought up to date.
- **G17:** `scratch-db/test_r2_08.py` and `test_r2_09.py` hardcode the SQL folder as `/home/claude/ca-meetup-register/scratch-db/`, so they fail unless copies of the SQL files are placed there (section 9 does this; do not commit those copies). Cleaner fix: make them use `/home/claude/ca-meetup-register/sql/` like `test_r2_10.py`.
- **G18:** the test counts in the old files said `test_r2_02` has 55 checks (572 in total); it has 54 (675 in total across all ten suites). No test fails.
- **G19:** the browser suites could not be run here. **Resolved 27 Oct 2026:** they run (Chromium is pre-installed; section 9).
- **G20:** the old recipe told the next session to use the CURRENT `schema_snapshot.txt` as the test base. That no longer works because it already contains Release 2; use the pre-Release-2 snapshot `161e7ed` (section 9).


---

## 9. THE TEST ENVIRONMENT (rebuild in about 10 minutes; Claude's container is wiped between chats)

**Principle:** the test database is built from the **pre-Release-2** snapshot (commit `161e7ed`, 17 Oct 2026), then `r2_01` to `r2_11` are applied on top. The current snapshot already contains them. Run everything with bash. `github.com`, PyPI and npm are reachable; the repo is public, so no login is needed (a full clone, not a shallow one, because `git show` needs history).

```bash
mkdir -p /home/claude/sql /home/claude/scratch && cd /home/claude
git clone https://github.com/rameezmunirrr-gh/ca-meetup-register.git && cd ca-meetup-register
git show 161e7ed:sql/schema_snapshot.txt > /home/claude/sql/schema_snapshot.txt   # the BASE (pre-Release-2)
cp sql/r2_*.sql /home/claude/scratch/ && cp scratch-db/*.py /home/claude/scratch/
cp sql/r2_0*.sql sql/r2_1*.sql scratch-db/      # test_r2_08/09 look here (G17); do not commit these copies
apt-get update -qq; DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y -qq postgresql
pip install -q psycopg2-binary --break-system-packages
rm -rf /tmp/pgdata && mkdir /tmp/pgdata && chown postgres /tmp/pgdata
su postgres -c "/usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/initdb -D /tmp/pgdata -A trust >/dev/null"
su postgres -c "/usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/pg_ctl -D /tmp/pgdata -o '-p 5544 -k /tmp' -l /tmp/pg.log start"
cd /home/claude/scratch && python3 build.py
for n in 01 02 03 04 05 06 08 09 10 11; do python3 test_r2_$n.py | tail -1; done
# expected: 62, 54, 153, 157, 77, 68, 36, 14, 26, 28 passed (675), 0 failed
```

**How the harness works** (`lib.py`): `fresh([sql files])` rebuilds the database from `build.sql` and applies the files; `seed()` makes an open event, one admin, booking A (Asha 9000000001, Ben 9000000002) and booking B (Carl 9000000003), all paid; `call(role, sql, params, uid, headers)` runs one statement as `anon`, `authenticated` (with `uid` as the logged-in user) or `postgres`; `call_new` + `par` run statements at the same instant on separate connections (race tests); `sql()` runs as superuser; `T` collects PASS/FAIL and **a script that crashes halfway counts as a failure**. `ensure_server()` restarts Postgres if it stopped. Test scripts hardcode `/home/claude/scratch` and `/home/claude/sql`.

**Replica quirks (patched in `lib.fresh`):** `settings_log.id` and `tickets.reg_seq` are identity columns in production but the snapshot does not show it; `report` is a view; `storage.objects` is a stub; the roles `anon/authenticated/service_role` and `auth.uid()` are stand-ins (user id from `request.jwt.claim.sub`; request headers from `request.headers`). `build.py` also reproduces the row-level security, policies and table grants of the old tables from the snapshot. Not reproduced: Supabase's default privilege letters (G15), storage policies, event triggers, `rls_auto_enable`.

**Gotchas that cost time before:** in `psycopg2` a literal `%` in a statement that has parameters must be `%%`; `ON_ERROR_STOP` makes a failing SQL file stop `fresh()`; the first pass of function creation may report an ordering error that the second pass fixes (expected); uuid values come back as strings.

**Comparing the real database with the tested one** (do this after ANY SQL goes live, as on 25 and 26 Oct): (1) ask the owner to run Actions → Database Snapshot → Run workflow, then `git pull`; (2) in the scratch folder run a script that calls `fresh([...all r2 files except r2_07, in order r2_01, r2_02, r2_02b, r2_02c, r2_03, r2_04, r2_05, r2_06, r2_08, r2_09, r2_10, r2_11])`; (3) take the SQL between `<<'SQL'` and `SQL` in `.github/workflows/schema-snapshot.yml`, remove the `STORAGE BUCKETS` query and the leading spaces, run it with `psql -h /tmp -p 5544 -U postgres -d postgres -X -A -t -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f snap.sql > scratch_snapshot.txt`; (4) split both files at the `=== SECTION ===` lines and diff section by section. Expected on 26 Oct: identical except storage policies, event triggers, `rls_auto_enable`, storage buckets, and the privilege letters of G15.

**Browser suites (restored 27 Oct 2026):** `scratch-db/browser/run_public.py`, `run_admin.py`, `run_gate.py` (+ `admin_test.py`, `mock_supabase.js`, `chart_stub.js`) use Playwright with Chromium against a **mocked** Supabase and read the pages from `/home/claude/ca-meetup-register`. **Chromium and Playwright are pre-installed in the chat sandbox: just run them. Do NOT run `playwright install`** (it produced nothing and was the cause of the earlier belief that Chromium could not be installed). Run: `cd scratch-db/browser && python3 run_public.py | tail -1`, same for `run_admin.py` and `run_gate.py` (run these two WITHOUT `python3 -I`: they import `admin_test.py` from their own folder). **Result on 27 Oct 2026: public 101, admin 47, gate 9, all pass.** They prove the pages call the right functions with the right values and show the right text, not that the real database answers like the scratch copy. **When you change wording, update the matching `check(...)` texts in `run_public.py`.**

**Phone screenshots:** load `index.html` through a Playwright route with the `MOCK` block copied from `run_public.py`; use a browser context with viewport 390 x 844, `device_scale_factor` 2, `is_mobile`, `has_touch` and `reduced_motion='reduce'` (otherwise the scroll-reveal cards stay hidden in a full-page shot); set the screen with `S.step='...'; render()` and take a full-page screenshot. Google Fonts are not reachable from the sandbox, so shots use a fallback font.

**QR check (do this again if the QR drawing ever changes):** in a blank Playwright page load the real `qrcode-generator` (npm), run the page's own `drawQR` (the text between `const QRLOGO` and `function toast(` in `index.html`), export the canvas as PNG and decode it with OpenCV (`cv2.QRCodeDetector`), ZXing (`@zxing/library` in node) and jsQR (`jsqr` in node), at full size, 300 px, 200 px, blurred and JPEG q35, on several realistic UPI links (long payee name, long UPI ID, an amount like 12345). Include one deliberately oversized logo, which must fail, to prove the test can fail. The scripts lived in the chat's scratch folder and are not in the repo; rewrite them from this description.

**The pattern for new SQL:** generate it from the real function text in the snapshot (`gen_r2_0X.py` extract it and patch only the needed lines, asserting each patch applies exactly once) so nothing else drifts; write the tests first as attacks; then do a **deliberate-mistake check** (copy the SQL, break one rule, confirm the suite fails; a green run alone proves little). After the owner runs it: paste it into `sql/changes.sql`, run the snapshot workflow, compare.

## 10. HOW TO WORK WITH THIS OWNER

- Plain language, short steps, no jargon; they are a beginner. Give step-by-step instructions. Since 27 Oct 2026 Claude normally pushes a branch itself (section 10); when a file has to go through the GitHub web editor, give a **complete file**, never partial edits. Ask before changing behaviour they decided; record decisions in `PROJECT_NOTES.md`. State assumptions plainly.
- Never put secrets, keys, real phone numbers or UPI IDs in files (the repo is public). Never ask for the Supabase service-role key or the database password. The publishable key and project URL in the pages are safe by design.
- **Delivery (since 27 Oct 2026):** SQL goes into the Supabase SQL editor (tell them where to click and what "Success" looks like; send long SQL as a file). **Page and document changes: Claude has push access to the repo** (the owner attached it with the `add_repo` tool and access `push`; a fresh chat may have to do that again, then clone into `/home/claude/ca-meetup-register`). **Claude works on a NEW branch from the latest `main`, runs the tests, pushes the branch and gives the owner the link `https://github.com/rameezmunirrr-gh/ca-meetup-register/pull/new/<branch>`. The owner presses Create pull request, then Merge pull request.** GitHub Pages redeploys in about a minute, then the owner hard-reloads. If the branch is not merged yet and the owner asks for a follow-up on the same screen, add a commit to the same branch. Claude never pushes to `main`. **A "Stop hook" may say a branch "has unpushed commits and no remote branch": every time so far this was a false alarm.** Check with `git ls-remote --heads origin <branch>`; if the hash equals `git rev-parse HEAD` it is pushed. Rule from the earlier sessions still stands: **SQL first, then publish the page.** (Fallback if the repo is not attached: complete files uploaded in the GitHub web editor, files not folders; the trash-can icon on a GitHub file page DELETES the file.)
- Safety over speed. Credits matter to the owner: batch tool calls, avoid re-reading big files, finish a step and record it.
- Say plainly what was NOT verified after every task.

---

## 11. THE NEXT SESSION'S TASK LIST (in order, with "done when")

1. ~~Ask the section-1 questions.~~ **Done 26 Oct 2026** (answers in section 1).
2. ~~Bring `PROJECT_NOTES.md` up to date.~~ **Done 26 Oct 2026** (commit `b53fee7`, verified identical to what Claude sent). Keep it true after each task.
3. **Further modification** of the app as the owner asks (this is the current stage; the owner says the app is not ready for launch). For each change: read the current files, work on a branch, run all three browser suites, say what was not verified, update the notes and this file. **Done on the public page by 27 Oct 2026:** second restyle, reworded text (including transfers and About), phone layout, payment QR logo. **Not looked at yet:** the wording and phone layout of Admin and Gate (the owner said "public page only, as of now"); the About page content (waiting for the owner).
4. ~~Restore browser testing.~~ **Done 27 Oct 2026** (101 / 47 / 9 pass; method in section 9).
5. Small housekeeping when convenient: fix G17, optionally G15, delete merged branches, write a real `README.md`.
6. **Pre-launch checks with the owner** (section 1, question 3; `PROJECT_NOTES.md` section 11), then opening registration when the owner decides. Done when each item is confirmed in Admin → Settings and the Actions tab shows green ticks.
7. **After the event:** section 8.1 item 5.

After each task: update `PROJECT_NOTES.md` (changelog + status) and this file's state lines, and say what was not verified.

---

## 12. GLOSSARY

- **Seller / transferor:** the ticket holder giving up the seat. **Buyer / transferee:** the person receiving it.
- **Code:** 6 characters the seller gets; whoever has it can open the Transfer Form.
- **Call tick:** the admin's confirmation that they phoned the number registered on the original ticket; the real identity check, required before Transfer.
- **Transfer (button):** `admin_transfer_approve`, the swap.
- **Retired ticket:** the seller's ticket after transfer (`transferred_out_at` set); its number is never reused.
- **Transfer booking:** the buyer's new Booking ID (`kind = 'transfer'`), no seat until approved.
- **Held now / return due / to pay out:** panel terms in `admin_transfer_money()`.
- **Snapshot:** the nightly dump of the real database structure in `sql/schema_snapshot.txt`; the truth for rebuilding the test copy.
- **Piece N:** one SQL file of Release 2 (`r2_0N_*.sql`).

`raises` = the call fails and the exception text is the code; `returns` = the call succeeds and the answer is `{ok:false, error:CODE}` (so the page has one shape). Changes since the 23 Oct version: `COORDINATOR` is gone from `private_sell` and `public_sell` (coordinators may sell, r2_08); `set_coordinator` can raise `ALREADY_TRANSFERRED`; new `FEEDBACK_OFF`, `INVALID_RATING`, `INVALID_COMMENT`, `EMPTY_FEEDBACK`, `BOOKING_NOT_FOUND` (feedback), `INVALID_VALUE` (the three switches), `PAYMENT_INFO_MISSING` (cannot switch transfers on without UPI ID, payee name and WhatsApp number).

Codes with no obvious reading: `MISMATCH` (any wrong detail, never says which), `TRY_AGAIN` (two requests collided; retry), `CONTACT_ADMIN` (only an admin can end it now), `NOT_ACTIVE`/`NOT_PENDING` (wrong stage), `USE_TRANSFER_TOOLS` (do not verify a transfer booking in the Bookings tab), `PAYMENT_NOT_VERIFIED`, `CALL_NOT_CONFIRMED`, `SELLER_CHECKED_IN` (the seller already entered the hall). `admit_ticket` answers with `{result: ok | already_scanned | invalid | cancelled | pending | rejected | ...}`; for `cancelled` it includes `name`, `label` and `old_label`.

## APPENDIX B. REAL RESPONSES CAPTURED FROM THE TEST DATABASE (fake data)
